# Objectives
The purposes of this project are to showcase for data cleaning and data analysis (via Excel, R, and Python). The used dataset herein is about sales records for 4 years from different retail channels.

Note : The dataset was originally obtained from a course in 365 data science and then modified by myself for only learning purposes. 

## For data cleaning
The raw dataset contains several mistakes, including :
- Empty row
- Data type error
- Missing value
- Duplicated row
- White space
- Misspelled item

The full article for explanation about this part (in Thai) was published in my blog. 
You can look up in this [Link](https://attasithp.wordpress.com/2022/12/05/data-cleaning-3-ways/).

## For data analysis
I showed the code for obtaining the pivot table from the dataset by using R and Python in order to compare with Excel.

Further analysis was achieved and presented by a Dashboard from Looker Studio. The explaination about the dashboard was elaborated [here](https://attasithp.wordpress.com/2022/12/16/compare-pivot-table-3-ways-and-looker-studio/).
