# Objectives
The purposes of this project are to showcase for data cleaning and data analysis (via Excel, R, and Python).

The used dataset herein is about sales records for 4 years from different retail channels.

## For data cleaning
The raw dataset contains several mistakes, including :
- Empty row
- Data type error
- Missing value
- Duplicated row
- White space
- Misspelled item

The full article for explanation this part was published in my blog. You can look up [here](https://attasithp.wordpress.com/2022/12/05/data-cleaning-3-ways/).

Note : The dataset was originally obtained from a course in 365 data science and then modified by myself for only learning purposes.
